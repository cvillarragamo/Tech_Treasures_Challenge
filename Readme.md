# Tech Treasures Challenge - Critical Minerals Exploration Dashboard

## Overview
This repository is part of the **[Tech Treasures Challenge](https://getech.com/news/getech-collaborates-with-thinkonward-to-develop-ai-powered-critical-minerals-exploration-dashboard/?utm_campaign=2024%20Challenges%20and%20Bounties&utm_content=304316993&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-40889185)**, a collaborative effort between Getech and ThinkOnward. The challenge focuses on developing an AI-powered dashboard for critical minerals exploration, leveraging data science and potential fields data.

## Challenge Description
The Tech Treasures Challenge is aimed at creating innovative solutions for mineral exploration through the use of data science tools. Participants will build dashboards that provide novel insights into critical minerals data, utilizing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).

- **Organizer:** ThinkOnward
- **Partner:** Getech, a leader in subsurface resource exploration
- **Objective:** Develop a critical minerals exploration dashboard
- **Duration:** August - September 2024
- **Submission Deadline:** End of September 2024

## Project Status
**Work in Progress:** This repository contains ongoing work for the Tech Treasures Challenge. The final project will be submitted by the end of September 2024.

## Key Goals
- Integrate advanced data analytics into mineral exploration workflows
- Transform large datasets into actionable insights
- **Potential AI and ML Integration:** As part of the challenge, I aim to explore AI and ML integration. I'll see how far I can get in implementing these technologies into the dashboard.
