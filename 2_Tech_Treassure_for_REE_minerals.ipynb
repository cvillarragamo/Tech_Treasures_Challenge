    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical minerals are crucial for technologies that drive global energy, security, and economic systems. This exploratory analysis will focus on Rare Earth Elements (REEs), highlighting their unique and essential properties. Here are some key points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The concentration of REE production primarily in China ([figure 1](https://unctad.org/publication/digital-economy-report-2024)) exposes global supply chains to geopolitical and logistical vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for diversified supply sources [[INN](https://investingnews.com/rare-earths-forecast/)].\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to the IEAâ€™s Global Critical Minerals Outlook, the major concern in the rare earths sector is not the demand-supply gap but the high geographical concentration of mining and refining activities. This concentration significantly heightens the risk of supply disruptions in the market [[INN](https://investingnews.com/rare-earths-forecast/)].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategically, governments are increasingly viewing REEs as critical minerals, prompting investments across the exploration, extraction, and processing stages of the rare earth supply chain [[MN](https://www.miningnewswire.com/three-key-trends-that-could-impact-rare-earths-in-2024/)]. "
